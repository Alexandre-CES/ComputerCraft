# Collect wood

## What this do
This follows step-by-step instructions to collect wood in a especific way, planting sapplings after chop trees.

## Problems
This is obviously hard-coded, so it doesn't detect where the tree actually is, you need to see it behavior to understant where put each thing, the sizes, etc.

## How this works?
1. Turn left, collecting 64 items of the chest (must be sapplings)
2. go to the pre-defined way, chopping the trees and planting new ones
3. if no tree is found at the position it should be, turtle will plant new ones
4. at the end, the turtle will store everything it collected 
5. Use any fuel at position 16 of inventory
